# Event Loading Fix - Summary

## Issue
Event "fireplace cat" scheduled for 2026-03-15 (March 2026) was not appearing in the invitation dialog despite being in the future.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Date Format Handling
**Problem:** The original code used `DateTime.parse(event['start_date'])` which could fail if the date was stored as:
- `"2026-03-15"` (date only, no time component)
- Instead of `"2026-03-15T10:00:00.000Z"` (full ISO 8601)

**Fix:** Enhanced date parsing to handle both formats:
```dart
// Now supports both formats
DateTime startDate;
if (startDateStr.contains('T')) {
  startDate = DateTime.parse(startDateStr);  // Full ISO format
} else {
  startDate = DateTime.parse('${startDateStr}T00:00:00.000Z');  // Date-only format
}
```

### 2. Event ID Field Name
**Problem:** Code assumed event ID was in `event['_id']`, but some events might use `event['id']`

**Fix:** Added fallback to support both field names:
```dart
final eventId = _selectedEvent!['_id'] as String? ?? _selectedEvent!['id'] as String;
```

### 3. Lack of Debug Information
**Problem:** No visibility into why events were being filtered out

**Fix:** Added comprehensive debug logging:
```dart
print('[INVITATION_DIALOG] Total events fetched: ${events.length}');
print('[INVITATION_DIALOG] Event: ${event['title']}');
print('[INVITATION_DIALOG]   start_date: $startDateStr');
print('[INVITATION_DIALOG]   is future: $isFuture (now: $now, start: $startDate)');
print('[INVITATION_DIALOG] Upcoming events: ${upcomingEvents.length}');
```

## Changes Made

### File: `lib/features/chat/presentation/dialogs/send_event_invitation_dialog.dart`

**Lines 44-99:** Enhanced `_loadEvents()` method
- Better error handling with try-catch around date parsing
- Support for date-only format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Comprehensive debug logging
- Clear error messages

**Lines 119-127:** Enhanced `_sendInvitation()` method
- Support for both `_id` and `id` field names
- Safer event ID extraction

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
When you open the invitation dialog, you'll now see detailed logs:

```
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Total events fetched: 5
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Event: fireplace cat
[INVITATION_DIALOG]   start_date: 2026-03-15
[INVITATION_DIALOG]   is future: true (now: 2025-10-19 14:30:00, start: 2026-03-15 00:00:00)
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Upcoming events: 1
```

### Step 2: Run the App with Logging
```bash
# Android
adb logcat | grep "INVITATION_DIALOG"

# iOS
# Use Xcode console with filter "INVITATION_DIALOG"
```

### Step 3: Verify Event Structure
Your event should have:
```json
{
  "_id": "67123abc..." or "id": "67123abc...",
  "title": "fireplace cat",
  "start_date": "2026-03-15" or "2026-03-15T10:00:00.000Z",
  "roles": [
    {
      "_id": "..." or "role_id": "...",
      "role_name": "Server",
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Your Event Will Appear If:
✅ `start_date` is "2026-03-15" (date-only format) - **NOW SUPPORTED**
✅ `start_date` is "2026-03-15T10:00:00.000Z" (full ISO format) - **ALREADY SUPPORTED**
✅ Event uses `id` instead of `_id` - **NOW SUPPORTED**
✅ Event uses `_id` - **ALREADY SUPPORTED**
✅ Start date is in the future - **YOUR EVENT QUALIFIES** (March 2026)

### Your Event Won't Appear If:
❌ `start_date` is null or missing
❌ `start_date` cannot be parsed (invalid format like "03/15/2026")
❌ `start_date` is in the past
❌ Event has no `roles` array

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Your Event
- Event: "fireplace cat"
- Date: 2026-03-15
- Expected: **Should now appear in dialog**

### Test Case 2: Past Event
- Event: Any event with start_date before today
- Expected: Should NOT appear (by design)

### Test Case 3: Event Without Date
- Event: Missing `start_date` field
- Expected: Should NOT appear, but logs will show why

## Next Steps

1. **Build and run the app:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/juansuarez/nexa"
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Open a chat and click the + button** (invitation button)

3. **Check console output** for `[INVITATION_DIALOG]` logs

4. **Verify "fireplace cat" appears** in the event list

## If Event Still Doesn't Appear

Check the logs for these patterns:

### Pattern 1: Date Parsing Error
```
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Event: fireplace cat
[INVITATION_DIALOG]   ERROR parsing date: FormatException: Invalid date format
```
**Solution:** The date format is unexpected. Check what's in `start_date` field.

### Pattern 2: Not Future
```
[INVITATION_DIALOG]   is future: false (now: 2026-04-01, start: 2026-03-15)
```
**Solution:** Your device clock might be wrong, or the date is actually in the past.

### Pattern 3: Event Not Fetched
```
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Total events fetched: 0
```
**Solution:** API is not returning events. Check EventService and /events endpoint.

### Pattern 4: No start_date
```
[INVITATION_DIALOG] Event fireplace cat has no start_date
```
**Solution:** The event's `start_date` field is null or missing in database.
